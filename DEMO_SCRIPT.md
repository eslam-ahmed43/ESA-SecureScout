## 0:00 - 0:30: The Problem & Hook
"Hi everyone. Web security is broken. Small businesses and students can't afford $10k pentests, and automated tools just give vague warnings. 

Enter **SecureScout**. We've built an intelligent security scanner that doesn't just find bugs—it teaches you how to fix them, powered by the new **Gemini 3 Pro**."

## 0:30 - 1:30: The Live Scan (The "Wow" Moment)
*Action: Open SecureScout Landing Page.*

"Let's see it in action. I'll scan this vulnerable test site."
*Action: Type URL and hit Scan.*

"Notice the **Real-time Terminal**. We aren't just waiting; Gemini is actively reasoning. 
1. It's analyzing the Tech Stack.
2. It's performing heuristic checks.
3. It's cross-referencing with known CVEs."

"This visualization keeps users engaged while the AI processes complex logic in the background."

## 1:30 - 2:15: The Results Dashboard
*Action: Scan completes, Dashboard appears.*

"Here is the Mission Control. 
- We see a **Security Score** of 45/100.
- A breakdown of **Critical vs. High** risks.
- But here's the magic..."

*Action: Click on a 'SQL Injection' vulnerability card.*

"Unlike standard tools, SecureScout provides:
1. **The exact location** of the flaw.
2. **Business Impact** in plain English.
3. And crucially... **The Fix**."

*Action: Point to the code block.*
"Developers can copy this secure code snippet directly. We close the loop from detection to remediation instantly."

## 2:15 - 2:45: Advanced AI Features
"We also leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities. 
Click 'Explain with AI'."

*Action: Click 'Explain with AI' on a complex issue.*
"This streams a personalized lesson on the fly. It turns a security report into a learning experience."

## 2:45 - 3:00: Closing

## 🛑 Backup Plan (If Internet Fails)
1. **Have the Dashboard Pre-loaded**: Open the app in a tab and run a scan 5 minutes before the pitch. Do not refresh.
2. **Screenshots**: Have a slide deck with high-res screenshots of the Terminal, Dashboard, and Code Fixes.
3. **Local Video**: Record a screen capture of a successful flow using QuickTime/OBS as a fallback video.
