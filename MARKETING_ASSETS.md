**Headline**: Democratizing Web Security with Generative AI

I'm thrilled to share our submission for the Google DeepMind Hackathon: **SecureScout**.

For too long, robust security tools have been out of reach for students and small businesses. We built SecureScout to change that.

**How it works:**
Using the advanced reasoning capabilities of **Gemini 3 Pro**, SecureScout analyzes websites for logical vulnerabilities and—most importantly—provides educational, copy-pasteable code fixes.

**Key Features:**
*   Real-time "Hacker Terminal" visualization
*   Bilingual support (English/Arabic)
*   Instant remediation strategies

Check out the live demo here: [Link]

Huge thanks to my team [Team Members]!

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**New AI Tool "SecureScout" Brings Enterprise-Grade Security to Freelancers and Students**

[CITY, Date] – A team of developers has unveiled SecureScout, a revolutionary web security tool powered by Google's Gemini 3 Pro, designed to help developers identify and fix security vulnerabilities in seconds.

Developed for the Google DeepMind Hackathon, SecureScout addresses a critical gap in the cybersecurity market: the lack of accessible, educational tools for non-experts. While traditional scanners provide cryptic error messages, SecureScout acts as an AI security tutor, explaining vulnerabilities in plain language and generating secure code snippets.

"We wanted to build a tool that doesn't just find problems, but solves them," said [Your Name], Lead Developer. "By leveraging Gemini 3 Pro's reasoning engine, we can understand the context of a vulnerability and teach the user how to prevent it in the future."

**Key features include:**
*   **Search Grounding**: Verification of threats against real-time web data.
*   **Multilingual Support**: Full interface and report generation in English and Arabic.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Client-side analysis ensures user code is never stored.

SecureScout is available for free at [Link].
