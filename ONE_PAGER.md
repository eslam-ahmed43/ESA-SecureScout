## 🚨 The Problem
**Security is broken for the 99%.**
*   **Expensive**: Professional penetration tests cost $5k-$20k.
*   **Complex**: Traditional scanners (SAST/DAST) flood developers with false positives and jargon.
*   **Exclusive**: Most advanced tools lack support for non-English speakers.
*   **Result**: 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses who cannot afford defense.

## 💡 The Solution
**SecureScout** democratizes cybersecurity. It is a client-side web application that uses **Gemini 3 Pro** to perform "Cognitive Security Analysis." It understands the *logic* of your application, finds vulnerabilities, explains them, and **writes the fix for you**.
