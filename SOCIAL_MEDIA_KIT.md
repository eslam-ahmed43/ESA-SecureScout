**Headline: Democratizing Web Security with Google Gemini 3 Pro**

I'm incredibly excited to share **SecureScout**, our submission for the Google DeepMind Hackathon! 🚀

Cybersecurity has always had a high barrier to entry. Professional tools are expensive, and automated scanners are often confusing. We built SecureScout to solve this by putting an AI Security Analyst in your browser.

**What makes it special?**
Instead of just finding bugs, SecureScout uses **Gemini 3 Pro** to understand your code's logic. It detects complex vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS, and—game changer—it **writes the fix for you**.

**Key Features:**
🛡️ **Cognitive Analysis**: Beyond regex pattern matching.
🌍 **Bilingual**: Full support for English and Arabic.
⚡ **Real-time Terminal**: Visualize the scan as it happens.
🎓 **Educational**: Explains risks in plain language.

We're proud to leverage Google's latest AI models to make the web safer for everyone, from students to startups.

🛑 Traditional security scanners are noisy and hard to understand.
✅ SecureScout is different. It uses reasoning to understand your app's logic, verifies threats with Google Search Grounding, and explains them in plain English (or Arabic!).

**Tweet 3:**
The best part? It doesn't just find the bug. It fixes it.
Found an SQL Injection? SecureScout generates the secure, parameterized query for your specific tech stack. Copy, paste, secure. 🛡️

**Subject: Check out SecureScout - AI Security Scanner for the DeepMind Hackathon**

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a project I've been working on for the Google DeepMind Hackathon called **SecureScout**.

It's a web application that uses **Gemini 3 Pro** to scan websites and source code for security vulnerabilities. We essentially built an AI version of a penetration tester that lives in your browser.

**Why it's cool:**
*   It visualizes the scan in a "Hacker Terminal" UI.
*   It writes code fixes for you automatically.
*   It supports Arabic and English natively.
*   It uses Google Search to verify vulnerabilities against real CVEs.

I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!
