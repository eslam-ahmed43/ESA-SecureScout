*   **Text Overlay**: "Complex Tools. High Costs."

**Audio (Voiceover)**:
"For years, effective security has been locked behind a paywall. Traditional tools are expensive, incredibly complex, and require a dedicated security team to interpret. If you're a developer or a startup, you're often left flying blind."
